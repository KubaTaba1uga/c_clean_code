#Difference

Scope and lifetime are entirely different concepts.

Scope applies to identifiers (visability) while
 lifetime applies to objects (existency).

The scope of an identifier is the code region where
the object denoted by identifier can be accessed by 
its name. 

The lifetime of an object is the time period for which 
the objects exsists.
