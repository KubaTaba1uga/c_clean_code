There are three types in C:
	1. object types
	2. functions
	3. pointers

1. Object types:

	Each object has its own types, example:
		```
			int a = 8
		```
	It means that variable `a` is type of un-
	signed integer.

2. Function type:
	Is charactarized by number of argume-
	nts and type of returned object.

3. Pointers:
	Memory address location. Also called
	referenced type. The pointer type of `T`
	is called a pointer to `T`.
